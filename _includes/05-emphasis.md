I am software developer with around 6 years of experience. Most of my experience is as _backend developer_ and my main programming language is **Java**. But also had experience with another backend languages like **Python**, **NodeJs**. And as frontend I also had experience with **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **vainilla Js**.
As I said, most of my experience is as backend since time ago I wanted to experiment more as fullstack developer. So I started a _Frontend Bootcamp_ with the following topics: 
**ReactJs**, **Redux**, **Typescript**, **CSS3**, **HTML5**.
